# 2D-Histogram-Filter-
This project uses c++ to make a 2d Histogram Filter. The filter uses basics of robotics localization to be able to give the right probablity when the robot makes a movement to a certain direction.

the fllowing files in the project are:


. maps: folder that contains files of different representation of 2D matrices. 

. Test.cpp: a testing file that checks if different functions within the other files are working correctly.

. Helpers.cpp: contains the functions normailze and blur

. Localizer.cpp: makes use of initilize_beliefs sense and move functions.
